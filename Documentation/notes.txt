Run with mvn spring-boot:run
ALT: Package with mvn package then java -jar target/*.jar to run it.

- Created a Spring Initializr project with web and security (see Spring folder)
- Added a home page and some webjars to make it work.. to get angular working we need (from org.webjars.npm):
    - angular__common
    - angular__compiler
    - angular__platform-browser
    - angular__http
    - angular__platform-browser-dynamic
    - angular__core
    :: Should probably work out what each of these is and what it does.
    :: "AppModule is not defined" - probably still need to do some work there.
    :: On the website, old angularjs is angular, while modern angular is @angular, where the dep uses angular__ prefix.


This approach isn't necessarily the most effective as it's using plain old javascript via the webjar includes. It's
pragmatic of course for the purposes of this tutorial, but more sensible to use the proper nodejs-driven typescript
stuff when doing it properly. I'm doing this mostly to get the back-end sussed.


Created hello.js which is initially just the boilerplate to get angular up and running.
